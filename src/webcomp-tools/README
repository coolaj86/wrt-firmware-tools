DESCRIPTION
	
	Webcomp tools are a set of utilities for modifying the Web UI files embedded in DD-WRT firmware.

USAGE:

	The webcomp tools require you to supply the virtual and physical section addresses for the target
	ELF file in order to calculate the physical addresses of critical data inside the DD-WRT httpd binary.

	Although all of the required information can be obtained manually using readelf, it is recommended that
	you use the ddwrt-gui-extract script included with the Firmware Mod Kit, which will automate this
	process for you.
