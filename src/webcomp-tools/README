DESCRIPTION
	
	Webcomp tools are a set of utilities for modifying the Web UI files embedded in DD-WRT firmware.

HOW IT WORKS:

	The Web files for all DD-WRT firmware are embedded in binary files, rather than storing the Web 
	files individually on the file system.

	There are two files involved with this system:

		1) The httpd binary (/usr/sbin/httpd)
		2) The www file (/etc/www)
	
	The actual Web file contents are concatenated together into the /etc/www file, while the names, 
	sizes and offsets of each file are stored in an array of data structures inside the httpd binary.

	The structure for each file entry in the httpd binary is:

		struct file_entry
		{
			char *file_name;	/* Pointer to the file name */
			uint32_t file_offset;	/* Offset of the file data in the /etc/www file */
			uint32_t file_size;	/* Total size of the file data */
		};
	
	An array of these structures can be found in the httpd binary. The beginning of the array is located
	at the address indicated by the websRomPageIndex object:

		$ readelf --arch-specific usr/sbin/httpd
		...
		004372e8 -31416(gp) <unknown> 004352c8 OBJECT   19 websRomPageIndex
		...

	In the above example, websRomPageIndex is loaded at address 0x004352c8 at run time. Knowing this, the 
	physical location of this object in the httpd binary can be calculated, and the file names, offsets, and 
	sizes of the Web UI files can be extracted.

USAGE:

	The webcomp tools require you to supply the virtual and physical section addresses for the target
	ELF file in order to calculate the physical addresses of critical data inside the DD-WRT httpd binary.

	Although all of the required information can be obtained manually using readelf, it is recommended that
	you use the ddwrt-gui-extract script included with the Firmware Mod Kit, which will automate this
	process for you.
